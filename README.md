# Hi, I'm Patrick 👋

Operational Intelligence × Product Creation

Shaper × Translator × Maker building new ventures and products from 0→1.

## About

I speak three languages fluently: Operations, Product, and AI. Most people speak one, maybe two.

I've worked across 8+ industry sectors, from warehouse floors to operational front lines, **AND** designed the digital products that transformed them. That combination is rare.

**Shaper × Translator × Maker:** I see the business problem, translate across domains, and build the solution.

## Proven Track Record

- 5 B2B products built 0→1 (supply chain, logistics, field services)
- 70% cost reduction + 83% error reduction (multi-agent AI architecture)
- 16,000+ customers served (job management platform)
- 180× faster workflows, 95% accuracy improvements (operational systems)

## Current Focus

Building new ventures from 0→1 across multiple domains. Working in stealth mode.

## Tech Stack & Interests

- **AI/LLM:** Multi-agent orchestration, prompt engineering, RAG architecture, agentic workflows
- **Product:** 0→1 product creation, business model design, continuous discovery, venture architecture
- **Design:** Business design innovation (d.MBA), human-centered AI design, design systems

## Beyond Work

Electronic music producer, DJ, and VJ. Building creative tools and experiences that blend music, visual arts, and technology.
